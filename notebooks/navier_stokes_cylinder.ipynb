    "So far all our domains have been simple shapes such as a unit square or\n",

    "FEniCS supports the creation of more complex meshes via a technique\n",

    "geometries in terms of simple shapes (primitives) and set operations:\n",
    "union, intersection, and set difference. The set operations are\n",
    "encoded in FEniCS using the operators `+` (union), `*` (intersection),\n",
    "and `-` (set difference). To access the CSG functionality in FEniCS,\n",
    "one must import the FEniCS module `mshr` which provides the\n",

    "The geometry for the cylinder flow test problem can be defined easily\n",
