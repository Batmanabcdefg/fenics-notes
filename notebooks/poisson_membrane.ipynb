Click **Filters--Alphabetical--Warp By Scalar** in the top menu and then **Apply** in the Properties pane on the left. This create an elevated surface with the height determined by the solution value.\n",
    " - To show the original plot below the elevated surface, click the little eye icon to the left of `deflection.pvd` in the Pipeline Browser pane on the left. Also click the little 2D button at the top of the plot window to change the visualization to 3D. This lets you interact with the plot by rotating (left mouse button) and zooming (Ctrl + left mouse button).\n",
    " - To show the finite element mesh, click on `deflection.pvd` in the Pipeline Browser, navigate to _Representation_ in the Properties pane, and select **Surface With Edges**. This should make the finite element mesh visible.\n",
    " - To change the aspect ratio of the plot, click on **WarpByScalar1** in\n",
    " the Pipeline Browser and navigate to _Scale Factor_ in the Properties\n",
    " pane. Change the value to 10 and click **Apply**. This will change the\n",
    " scale of the warped plot. We also unclick **Orientation Axis\n",
    " Visibility** at the bottom of the Properties pane to remove the little\n",
    " 3D axes in the lower left corner of the plot window.\n",
