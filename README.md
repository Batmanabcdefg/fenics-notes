# FEniCS Notes

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, which teaches how to use finite element methods to solve PDEs and to solve difficult linear systems from PDE discretizations using FEniCS. 

The materials here were heavily borrowed from [the FEniCS Tutorial](https://fenicsproject.org/tutorial/) and [the FEniCS Book](https://fenicsproject.org/book/). However, they have been rearranged and expanded for teaching a FEM course and for the research in the NumGeom Group at Stony Brook University. These Notes will teach you the following:
 - Fundamentals of finite element methods
 - Modeling linear and nonloinear elasticity
 - Solving imcompressible Navier-stokes equations
 - Generating complicated meshes for FEniCS and specifying boundary conditions
 - Selecting iterative solvers linear systems from FEniCS
 - Fluid-structure interaction
 - Multigrid methods
 - Topology optimization
