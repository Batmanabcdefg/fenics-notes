# FEniCS Notes

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, which teaches how to use finite element methods to solve PDEs as well as linear systems using FEniCS. The material was mostly based on [the FEniCS Tutorial](https://fenicsproject.org/tutorial/) and [the FEniCS Book](https://fenicsproject.org/book/), but they have been reorganized for the teaching of a FEM course and for research in the NumGeom Group at Stony Brook University.

To get started, you need to set up FEniCS and Jupyter Notebook by following [the instructions here](../../wiki/Setup-Jupyter-Notebook-to-Use-FEniCS-Notes).

To study the Notebooks, here is the recommended sequence:
 1. [Fundamentals - Poisson equations](notebooks/poisson.ipynb)
    - [Case study: deflection of a membrane using Poisson equations](notebooks/poisson_membrane.ipynb)
 2. [Modeling linear elasticity](notebooks/elasticity.ipynb)
    - Case study (TODO)
 3. [Solving Navier-Stokes equations](navier_stokes.ipynb)
    - [Case study: Navier-Stokes for a cylinder](notebooks/navier_stokes_cylinder.ipynb)
