# FEniCS Notes

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, which teaches how to use finite element methods to solve PDEs as well as linear systems using FEniCS. The material was mostly based on [the FEniCS Tutorial](https://fenicsproject.org/tutorial/) and [the FEniCS Book](https://fenicsproject.org/book/), but they have been reorganized for the teaching of a FEM course and for research in the NumGeom Group at Stony Brook University.

To get started, refer to the [Wiki page](../../wiki).
